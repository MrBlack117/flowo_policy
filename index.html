        <h1>Privacy Policy for Flowo Client</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <span class="placeholder">09.11.2025</span></p>

        <p>Thank you for using Flowo Client ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>
        
        <p>Flowo Client is designed to be a private, neurodivergent-friendly task manager. Our primary philosophy is privacy-by-design, which means your personal task data stays with you.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect very little information, and we aim to be transparent about what we do collect.</p>

        <h3>A. Information You Provide (Stored Locally)</h3>
        <p>All task data you create, including task names, notes, subtasks, projects, time estimates (optimistic, realistic, pessimistic), and session tracking data, is stored directly on your device.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Database:</strong> This information is stored in a local Hive database on your phone or device. <strong>We do not have access to this data.</strong> It is not uploaded to our servers or any central database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Information for AI Features (Sent to a Third Party)</h3>
        <p>The App includes an optional "AI Task Breakdown" feature.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To use this feature, the text of the specific task you want to break down is sent over the internet to a third-party AI provider, <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI</a>.</li>
            <li>We only send the task text you explicitly select for this feature. No other personal data or task information is sent.</li>
            <li>According to OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API data usage policy</a>, data submitted via their API is not used to train or improve their models (unless you opt-in with them directly). They may retain the data for up to 30 days for abuse and misuse monitoring.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C. Automatically Collected Information (Usage Analytics)</h3>
        <p>To understand how our App is performing and to fix crashes, we may use standard analytics tools (such as Syncfusion analytics or Google Firebase Analytics). These tools may collect anonymous or non-personally identifiable information, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, operating system, and version.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Features used, time spent in the app, and crash reports.</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Non-precise location data (e.g., country or city).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is aggregated, cannot be used to identify you, and helps us improve the App's stability and features.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Our use of your information is strictly limited to providing and improving the App.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide Core Functionality:</strong> Your locally stored task data is used to display your tasks, calendar, and statistics within the App.</li>
            <li><strong>To Provide AI Features:</strong> We send specific task text to OpenAI to provide you with the AI-powered task breakdown.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> We use anonymous analytics data to identify bugs, understand which features are popular, and enhance the user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>To Ensure Security:</strong> The App includes a <code>SecurityService</code> that may check if your device is rooted or jailbroken to help protect the integrity of the App and your local data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage, Security, and Retention</h2>

        <h3>A. Local Data (Your Tasks)</h3>
        <p>Your primary data (tasks, notes, etc.) is stored <strong>only on your device</strong> in the App's private storage.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> We take reasonable measures to protect this local data, including using the App's sandboxed storage and built-in security features.</li>
            <li><strong>Control:</strong> You have full control over this data. You can delete it at any time by clearing the App's data in your device settings or by uninstalling the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Backup:</strong> Because this data is local, it is <strong>your responsibility</strong> to back it up if you wish to preserve it. We do not have a copy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Third-Party Data (AI Features)</h3>
        <p>Data sent to OpenAI for AI features is subject to their privacy and retention policies. We do not store copies of the AI-generated responses.</p>

        <h2>4. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We only share data in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Third-Party Processors (OpenAI):</strong> As described in Section 1B, to provide the AI feature. We have no control over how OpenAI handles this data once sent. We recommend you review their <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>With Analytics Providers:</strong> Anonymous, aggregated data may be shared with our analytics partners to help us improve the App.</li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect our rights, or prevent illegal activity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Because your primary data is stored locally, you have complete control:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access and Correction:</strong> You can access and edit your task data at any time directly within the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete individual tasks in the App, or delete all of your data by uninstalling the App or clearing the App's data from your device settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out of AI:</strong> The AI feature is optional. You can choose not to use it, and no data will be sent to OpenAI.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by posting the new policy in the App or on our website. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new policy.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
